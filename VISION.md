# Komunumo

## Vision

**Komunumo stands for a new way of organizing communities: decentralized, open, and fair.**

We believe that data belongs to the data creators (instances) – not to data-hungry corporations.

We are developing a transparent event platform that ensures the data sovereignty of individuals and groups. We are convinced that people and organizations come together best when they can decide for themselves where and how their events are published – without relying on central platforms, commercial interests, or opaque business models.

Our goal is a world where every community can organize its events independently, without disclosing personal data, and where events are seamlessly interconnected.

The data sovereignty of individuals and communities is the key concern of Komunumo and all federation platforms.

### Our Principles

- **Freedom through Decentralization**  
  Komunumo is not a central service controlled by a company. Anyone can run their own instance: for themselves, for a community, or as a public service for others. Moving between instances is easy, and no one can "take over" or commercially exploit the entire network.
- *Seamless Networking through Federation**  
  Thanks to the open ActivityPub protocol, Komunumo instances not only exchange events with each other but also with other federated platforms such as Mobilizon. Users of Mastodon and other ActivityPub services can follow communities, share events, like them, and register with a single click – even without a Komunumo account.
- *Privacy by Default**  
  We respect the choice between public presence and complete anonymity. Event registration is also possible without an account. For fully anonymous events, no personal data is shared with organizers – only the number of registrations. In addition, the browser exclusively sends requests to its own Komunumo server; external content is fetched server-side. This way, IP addresses and other visitor data remain protected.
- **Transparency & Openness**  
  Komunumo is free open-source software under the AGPL v3 license. The source code is publicly available, the development process transparent, and there are no proprietary modules, no paywalls, and no dual licensing. We rely on open standards such as ActivityPub to achieve maximum interoperability.
- **Long-Term Stability through Community**  
  An independent, non-profit association (in formation) manages finances, holds the domain and infrastructure rights, and represents the project legally. This ensures Komunumo remains independent of individuals or companies. Through memberships, donations, and sponsorships, individuals and organizations can support the development. Association members can actively participate in deciding the direction of the project.

### Why Now?

The future of event organization does not lie in isolated, regulated, data-hungry platforms, but in open networks that connect people, groups, and organizations – without restricting their freedom. The growing popularity of federation platforms such as Mastodon underscores the individual’s need for data sovereignty.

Komunumo combines digital sovereignty, data protection, and networking – and makes it easy to become part of this future.
